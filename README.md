# About Me:
Currently doing my undergraduate studies in physics at Seoul National University.<br>My code is centered around projects I need for my degree.<br>Most of my experience is in modelling physical phenomena and data analysis.<br>I am very comfortable with Python and have some experience in Java and JavaScript.<br>I am familiar with typesetting languages such as LaTeX with emphasis on the creation of research-quality reports.<br> I am also capable of creating scientific-level diagrams through the vector graphics editor Inkscape<br>
### Three Highlight Repositories:<br>
- The mechanics-projects repository showcases numerical integration models.<br>
- The Intermediate-Physics-Lab repository displays several data analysis techniques, polished figures, and the Lab Reports themselves.
- The Jewel-Box-HR-diagram shows both scalable function creation and effective data analysis in an astronomical setting.
